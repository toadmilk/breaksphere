Choose the authentication method that suits you best and start exploring BreakSphere's vibrant community of musicians!

Please note that additional authentication options may be added in the future based on user feedback and requirements.

## Organizing with Trello

In developing BreakSphere, Trello was a vital tool. My Trello board, accessible [here](https://trello.com/b/Mt7Uddx4/breaksphere), is divided into sections: 'Bugs', 'To Do', 'Maybe', 'Doing', and 'Done'. This categorization streamlined my workflow, enabling efficient task tracking and prioritization.
